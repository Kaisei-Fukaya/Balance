# Balance
js13k 2018 competition http://js13kgames.com/

Balance is a game about an unfortunate man forced to walk a line for eternity, or maybe it's just a game about trying to walk a tightrope (or slackline?) without falling off.

Move forward by pressing/holding "space" on desktop, or tapping/holding on mobile. There is no moving backwards, so take your time.

If you attempt to move when the rope is at it's highest or lowest point you will wobble. Wobble three times and you will fall to your certain death. Actually on second thoughts, don't worry I'm sure there's a net to catch you, just don't look down.

If you touch any of the obstacles you will also fall.

There are two modes: Classic and Endless.

Classic mode is a set of 6 predefined levels (I would recommend to play this first).

Endless mode is self explanatory, there is no high-score table (yet). So for now just give yourself a pat on the back for every 100 metres, you deserve it.
